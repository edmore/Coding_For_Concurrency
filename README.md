Coding for Concurrency Examples

To run the examples you will need to install the dependencies relevant to each language:

Scala: 

I updated the AKKA quick-start guide: https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-scala
I ran `sbt run` on the terminal to run the program, you should be able to use an IDE such as Intellij to run it as well (I just used the terminal)

Go:

You need `go` to be installed on your machine: https://golang.org/dl/. 
I then ran  `go run example.go` on the terminal in the respective folders.

Rust:

Rust you need to install the Rust compiler: https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

You can then use the terminal to build and run your program, for example (or follow the guidelines on the Rust site to use cargo):

```
rustc channels_pointers.rs
./channels_pointers
```
